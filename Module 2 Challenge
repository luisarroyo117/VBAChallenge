Given the assigment I notice that I would have to use a loop for the data in column 1 since it was in the thousands of entries. Next i set i =2 becasue the data started at row 2. With the help of my tutor I defined and label the variables. I use the function <> to loop through the ticker to result inone of each ticker. The quaterly change would be the difference from the opening price from the closing price each quarter.
to calculate the percent change: quaterly change divided by the start price*100 to get it inot a percent.Finally for the Columns 9,10,11, and 12 I assigned the output as their value.Finally with the help of macro recorded I was able to format the cells respectively autofit and conditional formating setting all negative values to red and positive values to green, and no change to plain white.
